# Prototype_DepositandSearch

Unit Test for Deposit and Search System is a project designed to implement and verify unit tests for key functionalities, specifically deposit and search operations. This project serves as a demonstration of writing and executing unit tests using a structured approach to ensure code correctness and reliability.

### Project Overview
Objective: Implement unit tests to validate the behavior of deposit and search functionalities.

### Features
- Unit Testing for Deposit: Verifies the correct behavior of the deposit function, including handling valid and invalid inputs.
- Unit Testing for Search: Ensures the search function accurately retrieves records based on specified criteria.
- Error Handling Tests: Tests for edge cases, such as invalid inputs, empty records, or large data sets.

### Usage
1. Compile and run the main test suite.
2. Review the test results to ensure all cases pass.
3. Modify the test cases to cover additional scenarios, if needed.

### Project Structure
- ```DepositTest.java```: Contains test cases for deposit-related operations.
- ```SearchTest.java```: Contains test cases for search-related operations.
- ```MainClass.java```: The primary class containing the system's deposit and search logic.
- ```TestRunner.java```: Executes all test cases and generates a summary of test results.
